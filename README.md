#Inductor magnetic field simulator and maximizer:

This program is meant to simulate the magnetic field of an inductor and plot it, 
a machine learning will be used to optimize said coil, you will be able to use
the magnetic field simulator on its own. There will be a magnetic field generator 
in which youll be able to introduce the parameters of the coil you want to simulate
and the generator will plot it for you. :)

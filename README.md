#Inductor magnetic field simulator and maximizer:

This program is meant to simulate the magnetic field of an inductor and plot it, 
a a machine learning will be used to optimize said coil, you will be able to use
the magnetic field simulator on its own. There will be a magnetic field generator 
to which youll be able to give the necesities of your coil and the script will 
generate it for you.
